              In today’s digital age, our smartphones have become a constant
              companion keeping us in continuous contact with the outside world.
              With the current demand for high-quality smartphone cameras in new
              mobile phones, smartphones are increasingly becoming our <br />
              shoot-anything, take- everywhere digital cameras. Only a few years
              ago, clicking pictures and making videos with mobile phones was a
              compromise, with low image quality. However, times have changed
              since, and phone cameras have gotten better and better. Check out
              some essential hacks to capture the best images you can get from
              your phone: 1. Start with a good quality camera This one is a
              little obvious, but the quality of smartphone cameras is<br />
              increasing day by day. If you’re using an older handset, there’s a
              chance you could upgrade to better camera quality. If you’re
              looking to upgrade to a newer model, be sure to sell your old
              phone at CASHIFLIX for the best price and seamless & safe pickup.
              2. Set up the lighting Smartphone camera sensors are much smaller
              than what you would find in even a compact digital camera. Despite
              having very bright lenses, smaller sensors give mobile phones a
              distinct disadvantage in image quality in dim lighting. To get
              better quality, try to set up your shot such that there’s natural
              light falling on your subject. Sunlight has all the right<br />
              frequencies to make any photograph better. It’s always a good idea
              to open a window as opposed to using your phone’s underpowered and
              sharp LED flash. For those times when you need to click a picture
              without much natural light, the next hack may help. 3. Play with
              your camera’s exposure settings Smartphone camera apps typically
              offer some level of manual control to the photographer. A simple
              yet powerful adjustment you can make is the exposure. It can
              brighten or darken a scene. Using this feature may turn a bland
              image into an eye-catching shot. Android phones usually display a
              +/- icon for adjusting adjustment. On an iPhone, look for the sun
              icon to the right of the focus confirmation box and drag it up and
              down to brighten or darken an image respectively. 4. Use the rule
              of thirds You can turn on the gridlines feature in your phone’s
              camera app. Using the grid lines as a reference can help in
              keeping the camera straight. They’re also helpful in taking
              portraits in front of a landmark- keep upright structures<br />
              perfectly vertical in your photos for more aesthetic appeal. Using
              photography guidelines such as the “rule of thirds” can make your
              photos more appealing. It suggests mentally dividing up your image
              into nine parts using two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.
              The critical elements in your scene should then be placed along
              those lines, or at the points where they meet. The theory is that
              an off-centre composition appears more aesthetic to the viewer and
              looks more natural than a picture where the subject is placed
              right in the centre of the photo. 5. Set your focus up close Even
              without any add-ons, your smartphone camera can set the focus
              pretty close. This feature is one of the things in which small
              image sensors can work better than the larger ones. You can snap a
              picture up close while keeping the entire frame in focus. That’s
              something a big camera can’t do and can get you some stunning and
              head-turning photographs.
